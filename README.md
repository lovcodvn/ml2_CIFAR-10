# A Convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR-10

## Project Objective:

In this task, I am to build multi-class classification models using tensorflow.keras libraries on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The targated macro accuracy is at least 80%.

## Dataset

CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Models
